## Architecture Summary

```
USER (Mobile App)
├─ Register/Login → JWT tokens
├─ Upload file → AES-256-GCM encrypted
└─ Share owner_id with owner

OWNER (Desktop App)
├─ Login → JWT tokens
├─ List files assigned to owner
├─ Get encrypted file → RSA decrypt AES key
├─ Decrypt file → AES-256-GCM
└─ Print → Windows printer

BACKEND (Express.js)
├─ Validate JWT on all requests
├─ Filter files by role (user vs owner)
├─ Store encrypted files only
└─ Generate RSA keypairs on owner signup

DATABASE (PostgreSQL)
└─ 13 tables with proper relationships
```

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN LOCALLY

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18, **npm** ≥ 8
- **PostgreSQL** 12+ OR **Docker**
- **Flutter** 3.0+ (for mobile/desktop apps)

### Backend Setup

#### Option A: With Docker

```bash
cd backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

#### Option B: With Local Postgres

Ensure Postgres is running locally, then:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, JWT_SECRET, etc.
npm run migrate
npm run dev
```

**Server runs on:** `http://localhost:5000`  
**Health check:** `GET http://localhost:5000/health`

#### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Mobile App Setup

```bash
cd mobile_app
flutter pub get
flutter run  # For iOS/Android emulator
```

### Desktop App Setup

```bash
cd desktop_app
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows  # Windows
flutter run -d macos    # macOS
```

## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Database Setup** (Required for production)

   - Start Postgres (Docker or local)
   - Run migrations: `npm run migrate`

2. **Backend Testing** (Optional, mocked tests already pass)

   - Start backend: `npm run dev`
   - Test endpoints with Postman or cURL

3. **Mobile App Frontend** (Optional, for UI/UX)

   - Wire upload_screen to encryption + API
   - Add file picker and progress UI
   - Test on Android/iOS emulator

4. **Desktop App Integration** (Optional)

   - Create shared or desktop-specific ApiService
   - Implement printer integration (Windows API)
   - Add RSA decryption logic

5. **Deployment** (For production)
   - Set up cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy containers
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

---

## 📞 Support & Notes

- **Test Credentials** (use any during development):

  - User: any email + strong password
  - Owner: same, will generate RSA keypair automatically

- **API Base URL** (development): `http://localhost:5000`

- **Default JWT Expiry**: 1 hour (access), 7 days (refresh)

- **Encrypted Files** are stored in PostgreSQL BYTEA columns; decryption happens on the client side only.

**Last Updated:** November 13, 2025  
**Backend Status:** ✅ Functional (smoke tests pass)  
**Frontend Status:** 🟡 In Progress (screens created, integration pending)  
**Database Status:** 🟡 Schema ready (migrations not run — requires Postgres)
