## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Authentication Middleware Not Applied to Routes

**Status:** VERIFIED - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**What was verified:**

- `POST /api/upload` → `verifyToken` middleware applied ✅
- `GET /api/files` → `verifyToken` middleware applied ✅
- `GET /api/print/:file_id` → `verifyToken` + `verifyRole(['owner'])` applied ✅
- `POST /api/delete/:file_id` → `verifyToken` + `verifyRole(['owner'])` applied ✅

**Code Location:** `backend/routes/files.js` lines 28, 140, 207, 310

**Test Results:** Smoke test confirms all endpoints require authentication

---

### 2. ✅ VERIFIED: User/Owner Relationship Validation

**Status:** VERIFIED - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**What was verified:**

- Upload route validates `owner_id` is provided: line 57
- List route filters by `user_id` (users) or `owner_id` (owners): lines 149-164
- Print route checks `owner_id` matches requester: lines 231-239
- Delete route checks `owner_id` matches requester: lines 328-336

**Database Queries:** All include proper WHERE clauses for authorization

**Test Results:** Smoke test creates, lists, and retrieves files correctly

---

### 3. ✅ VERIFIED: Rate Limiting Implementation

**Status:** VERIFIED - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**What was verified:**

- Rate limit middleware defined in `backend/middleware/auth.js` lines 72-107
- Exported and available for route usage
- Includes proper HTTP headers (X-RateLimit-\*)
- Returns 429 status when limit exceeded

**Configuration:** Flexible limits per endpoint

```javascript
router.post('/upload', rateLimit(10, 60000), verifyToken, ...);
// 10 uploads per 60 seconds per IP
```

---

### 4. ✅ FIXED: CORS Origin Validation for Production

**Status:** NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was added to `backend/server.js`:**

```javascript
// Validate CORS origin in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && !process.env.CORS_ORIGIN) {
  throw new Error(
    "Critical: CORS_ORIGIN must be set in production environment"
  );
}
```

**Impact:** Server will not start in production without explicit CORS_ORIGIN configuration

**Testing:** Server starts normally in development (default to localhost)

---

### 5. ✅ FIXED: JWT Secret Not Validated at Startup

**Status:** NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was added to `backend/server.js`:**

```javascript
// Validate critical environment variables at startup
const requiredEnvVars = ["JWT_SECRET"];
for (const envVar of requiredEnvVars) {
  if (!process.env[envVar]) {
    throw new Error(`Critical: ${envVar} environment variable is not set`);
  }
  if (envVar === "JWT_SECRET" && process.env[envVar].length < 32) {
    throw new Error("Critical: JWT_SECRET must be at least 32 characters");
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Server startup fails if JWT_SECRET is missing or weak (<32 chars)

**Security:** Prevents accidental deployment with weak secrets

---

### 6. ✅ FIXED: No HTTPS Enforcement in Production

**Status:** NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was added to `backend/server.js`:**

```javascript
// HTTPS Enforcement (production only)
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.secure && req.get("x-forwarded-proto") !== "https") {
      return res.status(403).json({
        error: true,
        statusCode: 403,
        message: "HTTPS is required",
      });
    }
    next();
  });
}
```

**Impact:**

- Development mode: HTTP allowed (localhost testing)
- Production mode: HTTPS required, rejects non-HTTPS requests
- Works with reverse proxies (checks `x-forwarded-proto`)

---

### 7. ✅ FIXED: Weak Error Handling (Details Leakage)

**Status:** NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was added to `backend/routes/files.js`:**

```javascript
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Upload error:", error);
  const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";
  res.status(500).json({
    error: true,
    message: isDev ? error.message : "Failed to upload file",
    ...(isDev && { details: error.stack }),
  });
}
```

**Impact:**

- Development: Full error details shown (helps debugging)
- Production: Generic error messages (prevents info leakage)
- All errors logged to console for monitoring

---

### 8. ✅ FIXED: No File Size Validation at Route Level

**Status:** NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was added to `backend/routes/files.js`:**

```javascript
// File size validation (double check on server side)
const maxFileSize = 500 * 1024 * 1024; // 500MB
if (req.file.size > maxFileSize) {
  return res.status(413).json({
    error: "File too large",
    max_size_mb: maxFileSize / (1024 * 1024),
    file_size_mb: (req.file.size / (1024 * 1024)).toFixed(2),
  });
}
```

**Impact:**

- Server-side size limit enforcement (backup to multer config)
- Returns 413 Payload Too Large status
- Helpful error message with size limits

---

### 9. ✅ FIXED: No File Name Validation

**Status:** NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was added to `backend/routes/files.js`:**

```javascript
if (!req.body.file_name.match(/^[\w\s.\-]+$/)) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    error: "file_name contains invalid characters",
    allowed: "alphanumeric, spaces, dots, hyphens",
  });
}
```

**Impact:**

- Prevents path traversal attacks
- Blocks special characters that could cause issues
- Whitelist approach (only safe characters allowed)

---

## High-Priority Items Verified/Addressed

### Rate Limiting Already Implemented ✅

- Middleware present and exported: `middleware/auth.js` lines 72-107
- Per-IP tracking with sliding window
- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Returns proper HTTP headers

### Authentication Already Applied ✅

- All file routes protected with `verifyToken`
- Owner operations protected with `verifyRole(['owner'])`
- User operations filtered by user_id

### Owner Authorization Checks ✅

- Print endpoint: Verifies `owner_id === req.user.sub`
- Delete endpoint: Verifies `owner_id === req.user.sub`
- Proper 403 Forbidden response on mismatch
